  <REQUIREMENTS>
    <REQUIREMENT NUMBER="1" TITLE="Clean reversible install test" RATIONALE="A clean, reversible, installation allows users to successfully manage (deploy, and remove) applications on their system." />
    <REQUIREMENT NUMBER="2" TITLE="Install to the correct folders test" RATIONALE="Windows provides specific locations in the file system to store programs and software components, shared application data, and application data specific to a user." />
    <REQUIREMENT NUMBER="3" TITLE="Digitally signed file test" RATIONALE="An Authenticode digital signature allows users to be sure that the software is genuine. It also allows detection if a file has been tampered with e.g. infected by a virus." />
    <REQUIREMENT NUMBER="4" TITLE="Support x64 Windows test" RATIONALE="To maintain compatibility with 64-bit versions of Windows, it is necessary that applications should natively support 64-bit or at minimum 32-bit Windows based applications to run seamlessly on 64-bit." />
    <REQUIREMENT NUMBER="5" TITLE="OS version checking test" RATIONALE="Applications must not perform version checks for equality (== 5.1). If you need a specific feature, check whether the feature is available. If you need Windows XP, check for Windows XP or later (&gt;= 5.1), This way, your detection code will continue to work on future versions of Windows. Driver installers and uninstall modules should never check the OS version." />
    <REQUIREMENT NUMBER="6" TITLE="User account control (UAC) test" RATIONALE="Most applications do not require administrator privileges at run time, and should be just fine running as a standard-user. Windows applications must have a manifest (embedded or external) to define its execution level that tells OS the privileges needed to run the application." />
    <REQUIREMENT NUMBER="7" TITLE="Adhere to system restart manager messages" RATIONALE="In a critical shutdown, applications that return FALSE to WM_QUERYENDSESSION will be sent WM_ENDSESSION and closed, while those that time out in response to WM_QUERYENDSESSION will be terminated." />
    <REQUIREMENT NUMBER="8" TITLE="Safe mode test" RATIONALE="By default, most drivers and services that did not come preinstalled with Windows are not started in Safe Mode. They should remain disabled unless they are needed for basic operations of the system or for diagnostic and recovery purposes." />
    <REQUIREMENT NUMBER="9" TITLE="Multiuser session test" RATIONALE="Windows users should be able to run concurrent sessions without conflict or disruption.  Applications must ensure that when running in multiple sessions either locally or remotely, the normal functionality of the application should not be impacted. Application settings and data files should not be persisted across users. A user’s privacy and preferences should be isolated to the user’s session." />
    <REQUIREMENT NUMBER="10" TITLE="Crashes and hangs test" RATIONALE="Application failures such as crashes and hangs are a major disruption to users and cause frustration. Eliminating such failures improves application stability and reliability, and overall, provides users with a better application experience.">
